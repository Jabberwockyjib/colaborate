# TODO — Colaborate

## In Progress
_(nothing in-flight — Phase 5 shipped cleanly, tag `v0.6.0-phase-5`)_

## Next Up

- [ ] **Real-GitHub smoke test for Phase 5** — set `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `COLABORATE_GITHUB_REPO=Jabberwockyjib/colaborate` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, run `bun run dev` in `apps/demo`, draft a 3-feedback session, submit, verify 1+ GH issues appear at https://github.com/Jabberwockyjib/colaborate/issues within ~10s with `externalIssueUrl` populated and session status flipped to `triaged`. Required before Phase 7 dogfood.
- [ ] **Phase 6** — Linear adapter (`@colaborate/integration-linear`) + config switch (`COLABORATE_TRACKER=github|linear`). Drops in beside `integration-github`, same `TrackerAdapter` interface, no other code changes.

## Phase 7+

- [ ] **Phase 7** — Deploy to sop-hub, wire into parkland, internal dogfood
- [ ] **Phase 8** — README polish + public OSS release

## Phase 5 follow-ups (deferred during implementation)

- [ ] **Per-screenshot MCP resources with `blob` + `mimeType: "image/png"`** — same chip as Phase 4b. Triage prompt currently sends URLs only; if LLM vision is needed for triage, expose each screenshot as its own MCP resource URI (e.g. `colaborate://screenshot/{id}`) with `blob: base64`. Spec says "JSON + base64 screenshots" so the path is sanctioned, just deferred.
- [ ] **Auto-retry on transient triage errors** — current behavior is manual-retry only. Consider exponential backoff for `anthropic: 429` / `github: 5xx` failures before marking the session `failed`.
- [ ] **Polling / webhook / queue event-bus impls** — interface (`TriageEventBus`) is in place; only `InProcessEventBus` is implemented. If/when a second deploy unit becomes worthwhile, add `PollingEventBus` (polls `listSessions(status="submitted")`) or `WebhookEventBus`.
- [ ] **GitHub App auth** — current PAT auth is single-tenant. App auth needed if Colaborate ever runs multi-tenant. `TrackerAdapter` interface insulates worker code from this.
- [ ] **Optional polish:** `pre-existing` biome-info hints in `packages/integration-github/__tests__/client.test.ts` (use-literal-keys on `headers["Authorization"]` etc.) — kept for pattern consistency with `headers["X-GitHub-Api-Version"]` (which can't use dot notation). Could be silenced with explicit `// biome-ignore` comments.

## Phase 4b follow-ups still open

- [ ] **Per-screenshot MCP resources with `blob`** — same as the Phase 5 entry above; merge once one of them lands.
- [ ] **Optional polish:** extract `decodePngDataUrl` to `@colaborate/core/src/screenshot-codec.ts` if a third async caller ever appears (today it's duplicated across adapter-memory + adapter-localstorage; Prisma uses a sync Node `Buffer.from` variant).
- [ ] **Optional polish:** `server.test.ts`'s "lists all N tools" assertion is too rigid — adding a new tool forces touching an unrelated test. Consider exporting `ALL_TOOL_NAMES` from `tools/index.ts` and asserting the sorted name list against that single source of truth.

## Backlog — decisions deferred until needed

- [ ] Create GitHub repo `develotype/colaborate` and push (needs user confirm on org/name)
- [ ] Verify `@colaborate` npm scope availability before first publish
- [ ] Rewrite `apps/demo` marketing copy around the MCP/Parkland angle (currently still SitePing-flavored pitch, just rebranded)
- [ ] Pick Anthropic model + triage prompt template for Phase 5
- [ ] GitHub App vs. PAT for the GitHub adapter
- [ ] Upstream SitePing cherry-pick policy — currently no automation; cherry-pick bug fixes manually as needed
- [ ] **Freehand re-projection across element boundaries** — tagged `TODO(phase-1d-or-later)` in `packages/widget/src/annotator.ts`'s `rebaseGeometry` helper. When a freehand stroke spans two elements, the first-pass (1-px probe) anchor may differ from the second-pass (drawn-bounds) anchor; stored `points` are then relative to the first-pass anchor. Low severity; invisible for single-element strokes.
- [ ] **Popup-open drag race in annotator** — while `popup.show(...)` is awaiting, the overlay retains `pointer-events: auto`. A click outside the popup card triggers a second `startDrawing`; the first `finishDrawing` continuation then emits the first drag and `deactivate()`s, silently discarding the second drag. Pre-existing from pre-Phase-1c. Fix: set `overlay.pointerEvents = "none"` before the popup await and restore on all exit paths.

## Completed This Session (2026-04-18 → 2026-04-23)

- [x] **Phase 4b** — Screenshot ingest pipeline end-to-end. `ColaborateStore` extended with `attachScreenshot` + `listScreenshots`; all 3 adapters implement. `FsScreenshotStore` FS-backed impl in adapter-prisma (mirrors Phase 4a's `FsSourcemapStore`; `readIndex` ENOENT-vs-rethrow + move-to-front on re-put + positive-allowlist path guard). Three new HTTP routes (attach/list/read-bytes) wired into `createColaborateHandler`. Widget opt-in `captureScreenshots` flag + `captureViewportScreenshot` via html2canvas (bundled via tsup `noExternal` + `splitting: false`). Widget `attachScreenshot` on ApiClient (Bearer-authed) + StoreClient (direct). Launcher captures + uploads in a detached async block after `sendFeedback` resolves. MCP `get_session` + session resource populate real `screenshots[]`. New `attach_screenshot` MCP tool. Version bumped to 0.5.0. Mid-phase fixes: Task 11-surfaced session-route Bearer gap, Task 12-surfaced ignoreElements selectors fix, Task 10-surfaced tsup code-splitting regression. 1108 unit + 109 E2E green, zero lint warnings. Final commit `4dba14c`, tag `v0.5.1-phase-4b`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-21-phase-4b-screenshots.md`.


- [x] **Phase 0** — Forked NeosiaNexus/SitePing @ `widget-v0.9.5` (SHA `1bfb1db`) into `/Users/brian/dev/colaborate`, fresh git, MIT + NOTICE attribution, full rebrand (`@siteping/* → @colaborate/*`, `SitePing → Colaborate` across types/element/CLI/paths/keys). Fixed Node 25's experimental webstorage shadowing jsdom. Commit `e656ff4`, tag `v0.0.0-fork`.
- [x] **Phase 1a** — Replaced fixed `xPct/yPct/wPct/hPct` with `Geometry` discriminated union (6 shapes) across every layer: new `packages/core/src/geometry.ts` module, schema, Zod validation with `discriminatedUnion`, `flattenAnnotation`, all 3 adapters, widget annotator + markers, 14 new round-trip tests, all existing fixtures updated. Commit `ce24787`, tag `v0.1.0-phase-1a`.
- [x] **Phase 1c** — Shipped all 5 new drawing primitives: shape picker in the glass toolbar, `R/C/A/L/T/F` keyboard shortcuts, `DrawingMode` interface + 6 mode classes in `drawing-modes.ts`, per-shape highlight rendering in `shape-render.ts`, `perfect-freehand` smoothing for freehand, i18n en/fr, `drawShapeAndSubmit` Playwright helper + 6 new per-shape E2E tests. 831 unit / 103 E2E green. Final commit `ac27b1d`, tag `v0.1.1-phase-1c`.
- [x] **Phase 1b** — Schema extensions: `ColaborateSession` model, 9 new fields on `ColaborateFeedback` (`sessionId`, `componentId`, `sourceFile/Line/Column`, `mentions`, `externalProvider/IssueId/IssueUrl`), extended `FEEDBACK_STATUSES` (4 values), 4 new store methods (`createSession`, `getSession`, `listSessions`, `submitSession`), Zod wire-format extensions, `mentions.ts` module. Memory + LocalStorage + Prisma adapters all updated. 885 unit / 103 E2E green. Final commit `cb22e63`, tag `v0.2.0-phase-1b`.
- [x] **Phase 2** — Widget session drafting UX + session HTTP routes. Reviewer toggles session mode, draws multiple annotations (each a draft feedback linked to a lazily-created session), opens the session panel, submits → all drafts flip to `open` atomically. 4 new HTTP routes in `@colaborate/adapter-prisma` (POST/GET sessions, POST /submit with `$transaction`). `SessionState` + `SessionPanel` + `SessionToggle` widget modules; FAB gains a 4th radial item. `StoreClient.sendFeedback` now forwards `sessionId`/`componentId`/`mentions` (Phase 1b prereq satisfied). 4 session HTTP methods on `WidgetClient` (ApiClient via HTTP, StoreClient direct). `SessionResponse` wire type + `FeedbackPayload.status` now optional. i18n 8 new keys en+fr. E2E: 3-draft submit flow × 3 browsers + non-session regression × 3 browsers. 943 unit / 109 E2E green. Final commit `b13b8bc`, tag `v0.3.0-phase-2`.
- [x] **Phase 3** — MCP server exposing feedback to Claude Code. New `@colaborate/mcp-server` package. 6 tools (list_sessions, get_session, list_feedback, get_component_feedback, resolve_feedback, search_feedback), 2 resources (colaborate://session/{id}, colaborate://feedback/{id}), 1 prompt (/triage-session). Stdio transport (bin/stdio.mjs for local Claude Code) + Streamable HTTP transport with Bearer-token auth (Fetch-API handler — drops into Next.js App Router). Integration test round-trips through InMemoryTransport + SDK Client. Screenshots + externalIssueUrl write-through deferred to Phase 4/6 with documented limitations on the tools. Tagged `v0.4.0-phase-3`.
- [x] **Phase 4a** — Sourcemap ingest + resolution backend + widget dev-mode source capture. New `SourcemapStore` sibling interface in `@colaborate/core` (4 methods). `FsSourcemapStore` FS-backed impl in `@colaborate/adapter-prisma`. `resolveSource` primitive over `@jridgewell/trace-mapping`. `hashSourcemapContent` SHA-256 helper. Two new HTTP routes: `POST /api/colaborate/sourcemaps` (gzip-decompressed + hash-verified ingest) + `POST /api/colaborate/resolve-source` (resolves bundled line:col → original file:line:col). Both API-key-authed, wired into `createColaborateHandler` with a new `sourcemapStorePath` option. New `colaborate upload-sourcemaps --project <name> --env <env> --dir <dir> --url <url>` CLI subcommand. Widget: new `readDebugSource(element)` walker reads React fiber `_debugSource` in dev mode; annotator emits it on `AnnotationComplete.source`; launcher spreads it into `FeedbackPayload.sourceFile/Line/Column`. `FeedbackPayload` gains 3 optional wire fields (backward compatible). Feedback POST handler threads the fields through to `store.createFeedback`. 1053 unit (+60) / 109 E2E green. Tagged `v0.5.0-phase-4a`.
